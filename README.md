# ðŸ“Œ Assembly Programming Exercises
> This repository contains ARM programs designed to enhance low-level programming skills. Each exercise explores different fundamental operations of CPU architecture and memory handling.

## ðŸ“œ About
Implemented Programs:

- **Arithmetic Operations**: Addition of bytes, halfwords, words, and longwords with overflow handling.
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Implemented Insertion Sort in pure Assembly for in-place array sorting.
- **Fibonacci Sequence**: Calculated and stored Fibonacci numbers using efficient looping in Assembly.
- **Memory Access**: Sequential memory manipulation and efficient data loading and storing.
- **Mathematical Computation**: Polynomial Evaluation using Horner's method.
